**WARNING:** This plugin has a scraper included that fetch data from the [FIFA official website](http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/index.html "2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™"). All outbound links go to their website.

1. The scraper is deployed only if necessary (when someone visits a page or post with the shortcode [wp_fifa_world_cup_scoreboard] included or the sidebar's widget is executed).
2. When this happens, the plugin checks the last time of scraping. If there is new match unparsed will be deployed, otherwise uses data from an internal cache.

**What's new**

* The plugin is brand new.
* Check changelog please.

**Other features**

* Code should be updated frequently... As long as my team keep winning. LOL. Please at least, check for updates, before the second fase of the World Cup.

== Installation ==

1. You need to load/activate the curl extension. If you do't know what this means, just go on. Most servers have curl installed!
1. Download the plugin and extract its contents.
1. Upload the `fifa-world-cup-scoreboard` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

= Problems fetching data? Easy... = 

* This would be very rare, but if the scraper seems to fail, check following permissions in folder fifa-world-cup-scoreboard/
* chmod 757 php/tmp && chmod 646 php/tmp/cookies.txt (mandatory)
* chmod 757 log && chmod 646 log.txt (optional for logging)

= Template Tags =

*nomikos_fifa_world_cup_scoreboard_widget_manual*

Due to the fact that some themes are not widget-ready, or that some blog users don't like widgets at all, there's another choice: the *nomikos_fifa_world_cup_scoreboard_widget_manual* template tag. With it, you can embed the scoreboard on your site's sidebar without using a widget. This function also accepts parameters (optional) so you can customize the look and feel of the listing.

**Usage:**

*Without any parameters:*

`<?php
if (function_exists('nomikos_fifa_world_cup_scoreboard_widget_manual'))
    nomikos_fifa_world_cup_scoreboard_widget_manual();
?>`

* It will show random groups with date and one row by match.

*Using parameters:*

`<?php
if (function_exists('nomikos_fifa_world_cup_scoreboard_widget_manual'))
    nomikos_fifa_world_cup_scoreboard_widget_manual("date=1&one_row=1&a=1&d=1");
?>`

* It will show random groups if you do not pass at least one group.
* date (0|1): show date of match.
* one_row (0|1): reduce the output. useful in small sidebars.
* a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h: groups of teams.
